# Feed Reader Testing

## Description
This javascript testing application tests an existing web-based application that reads RSS feeds.  Testing is an important part of the development process and best done before ever starting development of an application. Good tests give you the ability to quickly analyze whether new code breaks an existing feature within your codebase, without having to manually test all of the functionality.The intention is for all the tests to pass using the [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) library so that the tested features function as intended.

## Installation

To run the application, you need to download all files/folders associated with this application packaging them together in a single folder.  Simply open up the index.html file inside your browser and the tests will run automatically.
